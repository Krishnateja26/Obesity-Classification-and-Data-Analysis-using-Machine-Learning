# Obesity-Classification-and-Data-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning

The goal of this project is to use various factors to predict obesity risk in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular disease.

The data consist of the estimation of obesity levels of 2111 individuals ages 14 to 61 from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia and their diverse eating habits and physical condition.

This data was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Obesity risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster).


The dataset had 17 attributes, many of which have acronyms for ease of coding, so I will give briefly describe all of the attributes:

* Gender: female or male

* Age: numeric

* Height: numeric, in meters

* Weight: numeric, in kilograms

* family_history_with_overweight (family history of obesity): yes or no

* FAVC (frequent consumption of high caloric food): yes or no

* FCVc (frequency of consumption of vegetables: 1, 2, or 3; 1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = always

* NCP (number of main meals): 1, 2, 3 or 4

* CAEC (consumption of food between meals): 1, 2, 3, or 4; 1=no, 2=sometimes, 3=frequently, 4=always

* Smoke: yes or no

* CH2O (consumption of water): 1, 2, or 3; 1 = less than a liter, 2 = 1–2 liters, 3 = more than 2 liters

* SCC(calorie consumption monitoring): yes or no

* FAF (physical activity frequency per week): 0, 1, 2, or 3; 0 = none, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2= 2 to 4 days, 3 = 4 to 5 days

* TUE (time using technology devices a day): 0, 1, or 2; 0 = 0–2 hours, 1 = 3–5 hours, 2 = more than 5 hours

* CALC (consumption of alcohol): 1, 2, 3, or 4; 1= never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = frequently, 4 = always

* MTRANS(Transportation used): automobile, motorbike, bike, public transportation, or walking

* NObeyesdad(Obesity level deducted): insufficient weight, normal weight, level I overweight, level II overweight, type I obesity, type 2 obesity, type 3 obesity; these categories are listed from lowest to highest body fat

This project also gives the conclusion to what kind of eating habit and physical condition variables are most related to obesity levels
